## Introduction

This repository contains a series of machine learning projects that cover a wide range of topics, from basic algorithms to advanced deep learning models. Each project is designed to be educational and informative, providing clear examples and documentation to help you understand the concepts and methodologies used.

## Project Structure

Each project is contained in its own directory with the following structure:

- `data`: Contains raw and processed data.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration and analysis.
- `src`: Source code for the project.
- `models`: Saved models and related files.
- `README.md`: Detailed description of the specific project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required for the project.

## Installation
