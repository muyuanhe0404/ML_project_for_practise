## Introduction

This project involves the analysis of online shopping data to predict customer buying intentions. The dataset used includes various features such as administrative and informational pages visited, product-related pages visited, bounce rates, exit rates, and more. By applying machine learning techniques, we aim to classify whether a customer will make a purchase during their online session.
